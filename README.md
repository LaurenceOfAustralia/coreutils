# Go coreutils

This is version of coreutils coded in go which changes some of names, default outputs and flags of the different utility's. For example 'cat' is now 'contents' etc.

## Compiling
Download the git repo. There is a build script called 'build_coreutils' which if you are really lucky might work. It shoves the binaries in ./build. Otherwise in each directory run 'go build'.
